# Physics_class.py
This code is a solution to a Python exercise that involves performing various calculations related to mass, force, energy, and work. It defines several functions, such as f_to_c, c_to_f, get_force, get_energy, and get_work, which are used to convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius, calculate force, energy, and work based on given inputs. The code also demonstrates the use of default arguments in functions, the concept of Newtons, Joules, and how they relate to force, energy, and work. Based on this code, it can be inferred that the person who wrote it has an intermediate level of knowledge in Python, including functions, variables, mathematical operations, and basic syntax.
